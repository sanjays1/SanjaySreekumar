I spent most of my life in the San Francisco Bay Area,  graduating college from UC Berkeley with degrees in computer science and business adminstration. (Go Bears!)

Currently I'm at [C3.ai](https://c3.ai/). Before that I was at the Department of Defense.

I'm particularly interested in data and entrepreneurship. Also I enjoy good food and making people laugh.
