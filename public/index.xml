      <description>‚ÄúConsider a turkey that is fed every day. Every single feeding will firm up the bird‚Äôs belief that it is the general rule of life to be fed every day by friendly members of the human race ‚Äúlooking out for its best interests,‚Äù as a politician would say. On the afternoon of the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, something unexpected will happen to the turkey.‚Äù

      <description>I spent most of my life in the San Francisco Bay Area, graduating college from UC Berkeley with degrees in computer science and business adminstration. (Go Bears!)
Currently I&amp;rsquo;m at C3.ai. Before that I was at the Department of Defense.
I&amp;rsquo;m particularly interested in data and entrepreneurship. Also I enjoy good food and making people laugh.
